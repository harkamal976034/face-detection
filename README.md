# face-detection
This project is based on the deep neural network in which u can detect multiple faces using your webcam or by using any photos.

# Libraries and modules used in this project
In this project i have used pre-trained caffe model of the deep neural network and i have used opencv-python,argparse,numpy,VideoStream.

# About the output of the model
The output of the model are the faces that should be detected and the probability of confidence by which the model is predicted.
